    <h1>What is Frameworks?</h1>
    <p>
        A framework, or software framework, is a platform for developing software 
        applications. It provides a foundation on which software developers can build 
        programs for a specific platform. For example, a framework may include predefined 
        classes and functions that can be used to process input, manage hardware devices, 
        and interact with system software. This streamlines the development process since 
        programmers don't need to reinvent the wheel each time they develop a new 
        application.
